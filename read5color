Understanding color
-A lot of people think Colors are all about harmonious relationships. But Saturation and Value are equally as important, if not more so. Without a clear understand of what saturation and value is, 
and why it's important, no color scheme will ever help you. Saturation is about intensity, and Value about Brightness/Darkness.
